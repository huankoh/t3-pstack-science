# Why

Investigate the motivation and intent behind code. The companion `how` skill answers what the code does and how it works. `why` answers what forces led to its shape.

Each spawn below names a role line in the model sheet and a default. Set `target` from that line's entry, or from the default if the sheet or the line is missing. Leave `target` unset when the value is `auto` or `inherit-parent`. If `delegate_task` rejects an entry, use the default and say so. If it rejects the default, use another target of the same family from `orchestrator_capabilities`. Under `mode: muse`, a rejected target never falls back to a standard or same-family default. Pick each subagent's reasoning level and fast or standard speed for the job, per the Subagents section of the **poteto-mode** skill.

Every spawn is a `delegate_task` child with full tool access, MCP included, which the MCP-backed investigators and the synthesizer's citation spot-checks need. Investigators still shouldn't write anything.

## Operating Posture

Operate as a **careful, cautious, and precise investigator**. Be honest about what you know vs what you're inferring. Read `references/epistemics.md` for the full confidence framework and phrasing guide. The synthesizer must follow it.

## Step 1. Understand the Target and the Question

The **target** is usually a chunk of code, a pattern, a feature, or a named design decision. The **question** is usually a design rationale, a tradeoff, a motivating edge case, an external constraint, dead code, or a broad history sweep.

If the target is vague ("why do we do it this way?" with no clear referent), make your best guess from conversation context (open files, recent edits, cursor location, what was just discussed). State your interpretation briefly so the user can redirect if you're off, then proceed.

## Step 2. Establish the Code Anchor

Before spawning investigators, build the seed context inline: file paths and line ranges, key symbols (functions, classes, constants), the last few commits touching the target, PR numbers from merge commits (pattern `(#1234)` in the subject line), and any linked ticket IDs. Run `git blame -L <start>,<end> <file>` for last-touch commits, `git log --follow -p -- <file>` for full history with patches through renames, `git log --oneline -20 -- <file>` for recent commits with PR numbers visible, and `git log -1 --format=%B <commit>` to extract PR numbers. Then pull the PR bodies and discussion for any substantive commit: `gh pr view <number> --json title,body,author,createdAt,mergedAt,labels,closingIssuesReferences,comments,reviews`. This anchor goes to every investigator and to the synthesizer.

## Step 3. Spawn Parallel Investigators

**Default to the full parallel investigation.** The goal is a complete coverage map, not a minimal one. Document the null, don't skip the search.

### Discovery

Before spawning investigators, list the MCP servers whose tools this session exposes.

Map each available MCP to one evidence category:

1. Source control history
2. Issue / ticket tracker
3. Long-form documents
4. Real-time team chat
5. Infrastructure observability
6. Error / exception tracking
7. Product analytics warehouse

Source control is always available through git and `gh`. For the other six, classify using the MCP name, server instructions, tool names, and resource descriptors. If an MCP could fit more than one category, choose the one matching its primary evidence. Record ambiguous cases in the coverage map.

Spawn one investigator per category that has a matching MCP, all in a single message so they run concurrently, each owning exactly one tool or MCP. Don't ask one agent to cover multiple MCPs. `target`: the `why investigators` line, default in [Models](#models).

Each investigator's prompt is `references/investigator-prompt.md` filled in, plus:
- the category playbook `references/sources/<source>.md` for the selected MCP, adapted from the examples in `references/source-playbook.md`
- `references/sources/incident-postmortem.md` **if the target code looks defensive** (null checks, retry logic, timeout handling, rate limiting, feature flags, egress guards, OOM handlers)
- the code anchor and the user's original question

### Investigator roster, one per available evidence category

Each category below is uniquely positioned to surface one shape of "why", shown after "Best at". Use it to know what to expect back, to name a gap when a category returns empty, and, only in the rare provably-irrelevant case, to justify a skip.

1. **Source control** (git history, `gh` for PRs, code comments, tests). Always spawn, the only guaranteed source. Best at *implementation-time rationale captured during review*.
2. **Issue / ticket tracker** (e.g. Linear, Jira, GitHub Issues, Plane, Shortcut MCP). Best at *the product or business forcing function*. Strongest when the why is external to engineering.
3. **Long-form documents** (e.g. Notion, Confluence, Google Docs, Coda MCP). Best at *long-form design rationale*, written out before it becomes code.
4. **Real-time team chat** (e.g. Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, Mattermost MCP). Best at *real-time deliberation that never reached a doc*. Especially important when the source control, ticket, and doc paper trail is thin.
5. **Infrastructure observability** (e.g. Datadog, New Relic, Honeycomb, Grafana, Splunk MCP). Best at *infrastructure and runtime reality that motivated the code*. Strongest when the target reacts to an infra signal (timeouts, retries, rate limits, circuit breakers).
6. **Error / exception tracking** (e.g. Sentry, Rollbar, Bugsnag, Airbrake MCP). Best at *the specific exceptions and error trajectories that motivated defensive or corrective code*. Strongest for catch blocks, null guards, type checks, retries, and other defenses.
7. **Product analytics warehouse** (e.g. Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, ClickHouse, dbt, Redshift MCP). Best at *product and data reality that shaped the code*. Strongest for flag-gated code, experiment-driven ships, data migrations, and "where did this number come from" questions.

### When to skip an investigator

Only with an **explicit, written justification** that goes in the final Sources Consulted. Two valid reasons:

- **No MCP is available for that category** in this environment. Flag it as a gap, not a choice: "Real-time team chat skipped. No matching MCP available, so the conversational record was not searchable."
- **The source is provably irrelevant**, not just "probably irrelevant." A high bar: "Error / exception tracking skipped. Target is a build-time script with no runtime code path."

If your scope assessment suggests a single-commit trivial target where the PR description already contains the complete answer, you may answer inline **only after** confirming all seven available category searches would be redundant. Say so explicitly. This should be rare.

## Step 4. Synthesize

Spawn one synthesizer. `target`: the `why synthesizer` line, default in [Models](#models). It gets:
1. The investigator findings, including any null results and any categories skipped with justification
2. The code anchor
3. The user's original question
4. The epistemics framework from `references/epistemics.md`
5. The synthesizer prompt template from `references/synthesizer-prompt.md`

## Step 5. Present

Present the synthesizer's output to the user. You may lightly edit for clarity or add context from the conversation, but **do not rewrite the confidence language**.

## Output Format

The structure is the one in `references/synthesizer-prompt.md`: The Question, The Code in Question, What We Found, What We Can Reasonably Infer, Competing Hypotheses, What We Don't Know, Sources Consulted, Confidence Summary. Adapt as needed, but keep the confidence separation intact, and keep Sources Consulted as one line per investigator, including the ones that returned nothing or were skipped, with the reason.

After Sources Consulted, if the user's `why` question is a precursor to changing this code, convert the lineage findings into a Preserve / Change / Avoid / Risk constraint set for planning the change.

## Common Failure Modes to Avoid

- **Recency bias**. Assuming the most recent commit is authoritative. The current shape is often the accretion of many earlier decisions. Trace back.

## Models

Role defaults on T3, stamped from `plugins/pstack/models.json`, one column per domain. For each task, before step 1 and before the first `delegate_task`, the chat picks the task's column and records it in the todolist as `domain: science` when the task is biology or other scientific work, else as `domain: general`. When the task changes, pick the domain again. When unsure, pick `science`. If the skill opens no todolist, record the domain in the first reply. The chat picks the column, writes each brief, and dispatches each step a skill delegates. Every role resolves from that column, so wherever a skill names a role's line, read `<role>:` under `domain: general` and `science <role>:` under `domain: science`. The column picks only the target. The reasoning level follows the **poteto-mode** skill's Subagents section in every column, never above `xhigh` unless the user asks for more in the chat or picked the `unlimited` budget in `/setup-pstack`, and an entry on the `deepseek` family always runs at `max`, its listed level.

In `science`, only `gpt`, `grok`, `muse`, and `deepseek` models read the domain's terms. A `science` dispatch to any other family carries a term-free brief. A default marked (term-free brief) gets one. Resolve an `inherit-parent` or `auto` seat's family from `orchestrator_capabilities`' `inheritedModel` before choosing its brief; an unknown family gets a term-free brief. A term-free brief states inputs, outputs, data shapes, invariants, formulas, and acceptance tests in plain math and code, with no vocabulary of biology or other scientific work. `<plugin root>` is the directory that holds this plugin's `skills/`. Write the brief to a file and run `node "<plugin root>/skills/setup-pstack/scripts/term-free.mjs" "<file>"`, adding `--term <word>` for each domain word the task itself uses. The check knows only the listed terms and does not prove a brief is term-free, so write the brief term-free first and use the check as a last guard. It exits 1 and lists each term it finds. Rewrite each listed scientific word. A listed word used in its ordinary code or math sense, such as a library, API, or variable name, may stay, and the dispatch ledger names it. When a term-free seat still treats a brief as biological research, add the words that set it off to `science-terms.txt` in a PR, with the brief excerpt as the example. Stage neutral copies of the code, data, and diffs that seat needs in its own directory, check each text input with the same command, and never point the seat at the original scientific files, papers, transcripts, or diffs. When the work cannot be stated without the terms, have a research delegate on the `science how explorer` line translate it first (its default reads the terms). If that seat's family does not read the terms, the translation stays blocked; never route raw context to it.

A line in the model sheet overrides each default. `<role>: <entry>` sets the general column, as in every sheet written before domains, and `science <role>: <entry>` sets the science column. The sheet is `~/.config/t3-pstack-science/models.md` (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/t3-pstack-science/models.md` when that is set), one per machine, and `/setup-pstack` writes it. When it is missing, use the defaults in the table below. An entry is `<providerInstanceId>/<modelId>` plus `<optionId>=<value>` pairs, and it maps onto `delegate_task`'s `target`, with the provider instance as `providerInstanceId`, the model as `model`, and the pairs as `options`. It splits at its first `/`, so a model ID with its own `/`, such as OpenCode's `<provider>/<model>`, is written whole after it. Option IDs differ per provider, so take them from `orchestrator_capabilities`. On a standard line, `inherit-parent` or `auto` omits `target`.

### Muse mode

An instruction from the user to use "muse mode" sets `mode: muse` for this chat. A quoted, discussed, or example use of the phrase does not. It lasts across later tasks and resumed turns until "normal mode", "standard mode", or "turn off muse mode", which sets `mode: standard`. A new top-level chat starts at `mode: standard`. Changing mode does not change running children. Record `mode: muse` or `mode: standard` beside `domain:` before the first dispatch. Under `mode: muse`, read `muse <role>:` from the sheet, else the muse default. Never read a standard line or a standard default. A `muse <role>:` line must name a target. `inherit-parent` and `auto` are rejected on a muse line. The domain does not change muse targets. Muse-mode seats whose family is a science term reader (by default Muse and DeepSeek) read the terms. A muse-mode seat whose family is not a science term reader (by default Opus) gets a term-free brief on a science task. Panels in `mode: muse` follow the normal two-family rule. Muse seats start at their listed level and are tuned per job per the **poteto-mode** skill's Subagents section, never above `xhigh` unless the user asks for more or picked the `unlimited` budget, and a DeepSeek seat always runs at `max`. The sheet `# budget` comment does not set muse levels. A rejected or unrunnable muse target blocks that dispatch and names the target and the fix. Never use a standard seat or the generic same-family fallback. A failed reviewer gets a fresh reviewer on the same entry, or the gate stays `BLOCKED: independent review`. The handback's extra reviewer under `mode: muse` is the first `muse interrogate reviewers` entry outside the work's families, by family as usual. Every brief to a child that can dispatch carries `mode: muse` and the domain. Muse mode moves helpers only. To keep the whole run on Muse, the user picks a Muse model for the chat in the composer.
